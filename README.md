# NMM---Compliment-Generator
Generate as many compliments in different formats as you can stomach!

### NMM has upgraded! I actually sort of learned how to make exe files and installers so now there is a fancy new installer you can download! Yay!

- I'll leave the actual python code in this repository, but it's really just there if you want to mess around with it.

- The installer will NOT generate a desktop shortcut automatically so please make sure to go to the installation path and make a desktop shortcut if you want.

- Your browser and computer will both probably try to warn you that the installer is not to be trusted. Yes I am not a known app publisher. No my installer will not kill your computer. I promise.

- If for some reason the installer isn't working for you, you can download the .zip file and extract the program that way.

### The program will ask you for however many compliments you would like it to generate. You can plug in "inf", "infinite", or "infinity" and it will spew out complements until you close the program. 

- If you choose to print infinite compliments and you choose the fast type option, you can click anywhere within the window to pause the flow of compliments. 

- You can then press enter to start it up again. 

- Fast speed prints too fast to read so I recommend doing slow speed for infinite.

## If you use my code to do something fun or cool, share it with me! Also, credit is nice to have too.
## Enjoy!
